# account-pirate
A basic tool that uses a vulnerability in Windows that's there since the beginning of time. Using this you can get admin CMD in the login screen directly.

**Just remember:** Don't do this on a machine that isn't yours, if you face cybercriminal charges that's not my problem :)

Requirements:

- A Windows PE USB (Windows 8 or newer)
- The tool itself (put it in c:\ and run it from windows pe)

This is what the user interface looks like:

# How do I use this?

You press the number on your keyboard cooresponding to the number of the option you want to select. For example press [1] to inject the exploit.

- Once you're in the logon screen (on the target installation) press SHIFT 5 times and a command prompt window will pop up.

After that type cmd-m and press ENTER. You will then have administrator priviliges directly on the logon screen.

**Note: The exploit works on both virtual machines and real computers. But please be aware of the legal risks of using this tool, and DO NOT use it unauthorized**

You will see a legal disclaimer when you launch the tool:
